Given a base URL and an expression represented in form of <funciton(arg1, arg2...)> <function(...))>.. calculate the integer ID of the next URL node which contains another expression-encoded ID, etc.

Accessing URLs in that order, build the resulting link topology graph. Starting from the node marked START find the shortest part through the IDs to the destination marked END. 

Functions expected: ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, ABS
